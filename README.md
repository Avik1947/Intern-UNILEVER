# 🧪 Prototyping & Scale-Up: Aesthetic Hair Mask and Serum Formulations  
**R&D Internship | Dove | Unilever**

## 🚀 Objective  
To develop new hair care formulations—**Hair Mask** and **Hair Serum**—enhanced with aesthetic appeal, without compromising functional efficacy or scale-up feasibility.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Consumers crave *efficacy with elegance*. Our goal:  
- Engineer **visually delightful** formulations (colors, beads, shimmer).  
- Maintain core **efficacy** and **sensorial integrity**.  
- Ensure **process scalability** under real manufacturing constraints.

## 🧬 Hair Mask Development

### ✔️ Aesthetic Features
- Dual color prototypes
- Cosmetic-grade beads
- Skin-safe shimmer dispersion

### ⚙️ Constraints
- **pH range**: 2.0–3.0  
- **Processing Temp**: ≥80°C  
- Compatibility of aesthetic agents with low pH + high temp

### 🔍 Work Done
- **Supplier scouting** for heat- and acid-stable beads & shimmers
- **Prototype iteration** with multiple bead/shimmer systems
- **10L pilot batch** executed with successful bead dispersion
- **Sensory validation**: Original product efficacy retained
- **In-situ consumer observation**: Captured preliminary consumer insight & voice of consumer(VOC) analysis

## 💧 Hair Serum Development

### ✔️ Aesthetic Features
- Cosmetic shimmer & floating beads

### ⚙️ Constraints
- **Silicone-based, hydrophobic matrix**
- Beads must match serum density to achieve suspension

### 🔍 Work Done
- Raw material deep-dive + supplier interaction
- Compatibility tests with multiple beads
- Optimized aesthetics without destabilizing silicone phase

## 📈 Outcome
- **Production-ready prototype** of hair mask with jojoba beads  
- **Validated user experience** via sensory testing and floor trials  
- **Technical feasibility confirmed** for both lab and pilot scale
